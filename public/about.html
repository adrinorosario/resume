    <h1>Hey there!!!</h1>
    <h2>I'm Adrino Rosario James</h2>
    <h3>Web Developer | Python programmer | Aspiring ML engineer</h3>

    <p>I found my fascination for technology and to be more precise- programming during
        the covid pandemic when I took a course on python programming. That initial course 
        and the projects that I built in that course, showed me the immense power that 
        programming has and opened my eyes to the world of technology and computer science.
    </p>

    <p>I have worked with various programming languages and at various levels, from basic
        programming, all the way upto getting my hands dirty with some complex Natural language
        processing projects. I've worked with Java, C++, Python and Golang as well as frameworks
        and technologies such as Flask, Pytorch, Selenium, Scikit Learn, Numpy and much more.
        In terms of web developement, I have experience working with HTML and CSS, CSS Flexbox and 
        Grid and I have also built some projects to showcase my skills.
    </p>

    <p>Something which really matters to me is quality and performance over quantity and speed.
        I strive to attain quality output while also keeping to the requirements and expectations 
        which are on me. 
    </p>
